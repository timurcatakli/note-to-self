### GIT STEPS & COMMANDS
***

```
git init
```

```
git status
```
```
git add
```
```
git commit . -m “Message goes here”
```

To see which remote servers you have configured, you can run the

```
git remote -v
```

command. It lists the shortnames of each remote handle you’ve specified. If you’ve cloned your repository, you should at least see origin – that is the default name Git gives to the server you cloned from:

**Create a new repo on github.com and do the following:**

    git remote add origin https://github.com/timurcatakli/lucky_numbers.git

    git push -u origin master

    Delete an origin

    git remote rm origin
